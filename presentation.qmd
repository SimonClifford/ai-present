## What is AI Dementia?

::: {.notes}
The algorithm:
1. Takes a 3D brain scan (a magnetic resonance image, MRI).
2. Processes it to reduce it to only showing grey matter.
3. Obtains some cognitive scores, usually from a database.
4. Runs the fairly simply Python code to reduce all this to a single score.
:::

The method^1,2^
uses a machine learning (ML) algorithm trained on brain images (MRIs) and cognitive
scores to give a prognostic score of the likelihood of the patient having Alzheimer's.

## The XNAT prototype
::: {.notes}
Inherited the project from an earlier incarnation developed by Piero and Matt.

XNAT is a research platform for importing and processing image data.  However, it's not generally deployed in clinical settings.

## Structure of the prototype
::: {.notes}
The code has various scripts that fire on particular XNAT triggers to perform the
algorithm.

REDCap is a "secure web application for building online surveys and databases".
It provides an API for recovering previously entered data.  It's commmonly used
in clinical research settings.

The Docker container is where the ML code is.

But Stretch is no longer supported, SPM12 was last updated in Jan 2020, and
Matlab 2010a...  Alas, it turns out we don't have the Matlab source code, only
compiled `.mat` files, so we are stuck until our collaborators come up with the
source.

```

The Docker container holds a
[Debian Stretch^2^ image]{.fragment .highlight-red} with [SPM12^3^]{.fragment
.highlight-red} and a [Matlab 2010a]{.fragment .highlight-red} runtime.  SPM is
a Matlab library for analysing brain images.

## Building on the prototype
::: {.notes}
1. XNAT no good because not widely deployed in clinical settings.
1. Want some client-server structure.
1. ADVANCE.
1. First deployed in Addenbrooke's, then other Cambridge Trust hospital, finally
some third party.
1. Turns out hospitals are putting all their infra in this fancy fly-by-night
thing called the cloud.
1. And they don't want random researchers installing things into their web infra.
:::
The PIs want to take this from the prototype to something that can be used
in a clinical setting.

[![](images/AWEBAPP.gif)]{.fragment .fade-up}

::: {.incremental}
1. Everyone has a web browser, no need to worry about clients.
2. Established network protocol, security available.
3. [[Can install it into the existing hospital web infra.]{.fragment .strike}]{.fragment .semi-fade-out}
4. I've written web apps before.

## Flask
::: notes
1. My favourite!
1. Flask doesn't require any particular database or structure.
1. Instead you add extensions for those things.
1. In the example explain this is the entire application. The decorator
registers the `hello_world` function to the `"/"` route.
1. When a request comes in on that route the function is run and its return
value sent back to the client.
:::
Flask^1^ is a lightweight and extendable web microframework.  

A (very) minimal application is:
```{.python}
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
```

## Flask
Flask^1^ is a lightweight and extendable web microframework.  

Then you can add complexity.
```python
from flask import render_template, Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/hello/')
@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name=None):
    return render_template('hello.html', person=name)
```

The `hello.html` template would have the `person` variable set to this
function's `name`.

::: notes
1. Usually have Jinja templates (unless designing an API) which can do
Python-like logic.

## Database
- App needs users, authentication
  - Somewhere to store usernames, hashes, requests
  - _Could_ use SQLite but gives problems later
  - Really like to use PostgreSQL
    - Have to assume user has it installed?
    - No!  Another container!

## Cognitive Scores
- REDCap DB

## Images
- Prototype was handed images
- We need to get them from PACS
  - Explain PACS
  - Explain DICOM
  - Pynetdicom
  - Show search page of app?
  - Conversion to NIFTI
  - Segmentation

## Segmentation slow
- Asynchronous web request
- User submits, goes away
- Req keeps going
- Celery!
  - But celery needs a broker.
  - Redis
  - Have to assume user has it installed?
  - No! Another container!

## Need SSL to keep secret
- WSGI hosters not always great at that
- Plus host may already do this
- Optional SSL bit then, reverse proxy, nginx
- WHERE CAN IT GO?

## What about testing?
- Can't test against live PACS, want to test PACS parts
- Mocking?  But this is the hard bit
- Could run a test PACS with safe data
- Oh ho ho

## docker-compose
- Show file
- Fun fact: docker compose inside a container will use the local container's `docker-compose.yml`
  but files referred to from that compose file are looked for _on the host_.
